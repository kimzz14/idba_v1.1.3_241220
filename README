Note that IDBA assemblers are designed for short reads (around 100bp). If you want to assemble paired-end reads with longer read length, please modify the constant kMaxShortSequence in src/sequence/short_sequence.h to support longer read length.

Please find the manual by running the assembler without any parameters. For example:

kMaxShortSequence : 128 -> 200
